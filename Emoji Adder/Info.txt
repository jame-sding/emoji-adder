I forgot to use the Model-View-Controller design, but this program still somewhat fits it.

Adder, DictFileEditor, and Similarity Calc as the Model.
AdderPane, EditorPane, and EmojiAdderGUI as a View-Controller fusion (their constructors mostly take care of the View, while their addActionListeners() or addListeners() methods take care most of the Controller). 

This backup was for version 0.7
There are still many classes and files (artifacts, I think they're called? not sure) that are left over from previous versions that aren't used anymore. Those files include: AdderController (when I used JavaFX), AdderProgram (JavaFX), Test (a sample Swing program from the Java tutorials), EmojiListFormatter, and EmojiTreeNode.

In order to get the list of all emojis as well as their names, I found text files in some secluded corners of the internet that contained emojis with their names. Originally, I found a text file from one source that contained many extra things that I didn't want, so I downloaded it and created the program EmojiListFormatter to remove those extra things. Then, I found an even better text file with the twemoji shortnames, and I created the program TwemojiListFormatter to remove extra things from that text file. Both EmojiListFormatter and TwemojiListFormatter can be removed, but I left TwemojiListFormatter just in case I still needed it.
